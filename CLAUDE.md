# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Godot 4.4 game project - a clone of the Suika game (watermelon dropping/merging game). The game involves dropping planets that merge when they collide with planets of the same size, with gravity physics and a game over condition.

## IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS

ONLY DO SMALL, ITERATIVE CHANGES. AFTER EACH CHANGE, PROVIDE OUTPUT TO USER LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE AND WHY. ONLY TOUCH PARTS OF THE CODE THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT WORK. PRIORITIZE SIMPLE, ELEGANT SOLUTIONS.
